The only thing this app does is enable abusive parents.,"This app has no function except tracking people. And while that seems fun and dandy, the first thing someone like say, a kidnapper, or robber, is going to do upon committing a crime, would be to turn off or leave the victims phone behind. So, “saving a life” disproved, the only thing this app does is give controlling, abusive, horrible parents and significant others even more control over their child, spouse, or significant other. “Make sure your kids are where they say they are!” I turn this app off for three seconds and every good thing in my life is threatened. So thanks life 360, for enabling abusers. I hope you know that your on teenagers and girl’s watch lists for “DO NOT DOWNLOAD”",Honesty,Power,Free will
Parents:,"why are you looking to track your kids? unless your kids have proven to be untrustworthy in the past, don't even download this. put a huge crack in my relationship with my parents and i'm not even the type of kid that needs to hide stuff. it's extremely overbearing and intrusive to track your child all the way down to how hard they brake when they're driving. kids have to make their own mistakes and live their lives, no app is going to stop that. the kids who actually deserved to be tracked are going to find a way to do what they want regardless (it's possible even w this app). also, the app is not always reliable so instead of using this, another option would be building a relationship and trust with your kid instead of making them feel like you're a probation officer. the app does however have just about every feature imaginable for being an overbearing, intrusive parent so if pushing your kids away and smothering them is your style, this will work about 60% of the time until your kid outsmarts it. enjoy!",Free will,Honesty,Cognition
Terrible App,"Life360 is such a terrible thing for unaware parents to use. Most parents think teens don’t need privacy and they constantly need to know where they are and what they’re doing and who they’re with at all times. This may make the parent feel at peace but what about the child? It’s selfish of parents to not take into consideration of how the teen may feel about always having this app and the parent giving them a very stalkish feeling, it’s very uncomfortable. It also effects the growth and decision making abilities your teen will need in the adult world. It creates total neuroses in kids and encourages and teaches them how to be sneaky which can be even more dangerous. You want to talk about safety concern? That’s what find my phone is for. You want to build a good, trusting and open relationship with your child? Maybe let them have a little bit of time without you always having a watchful eye on them. This app does not help, rather ruins teens social lives, and creates bad parent-child relationships.",Free will,Visibility,Honesty
Horrible app creates a lack of trust,This app only goes to show how little trust parents put in their children.

It doesn't matter who you are this is an invasion of privacy and if you think this is &#34;incase of emergencies&#34; you have to realize that you cant protect your kids from everything.

"please, please, read before purchasing","I understand that this app was originally created for safety reasons and I also understand its usefulness as a way of keeping track of mentally handicapped people at high risk. However, it’s use as a tracker for overprotective parents towards their teens is an invasion of privacy. I feel like I’ve been inserted into an episode of Black Mirror. Parents claim the app builds trust and keeps their children from doing reckless teenage things, but it really does the opposite. There is no reason for a parent to need to track their child’s every move. Teen years are for learning right from wrong and what gets you far in life vs what doesn’t. Helicopter parenting does nothing but teach your child 1) you have no trust in them to make decisions for themselves 2) ways for them to get around the app 3) that even family cannot be trusted. Making your children download this app will do nothing but tear apart the relationships you have with your children. If for some reason you feel that you cannot trust your child, that is something that needs to be dealt with over a civil, two-sided discussion, not an overbearing app. They are almost adults, whether you choose to acknowledge it or not, and you need to treat them as such. They may make mistakes, but that is part of becoming an adult. Your “peace of mind” is not worth them missing the experiences of high school and/or college. If there is ever a serious problem, your child has a phone with emergency contact info for a reason. Emergency contacts can be accessed whether the phone is locked or not, along with medical information should your child not be able to communicate it themselves. If your child was really in distress, you would find out almost immediately from other sources. This app is unnecessary and invasive. I beg you to not force it upon your children.",Free will,Honesty,Power

Awful app,"As a 15-year-old who enjoys my privacy, I do not agree with the morals of this app. Being a teenager does need to have supervision and I get that, but having this app makes any kid look like they have a helicopter parent, which is the worst thing in my eyes for a teen to have. When you parent knows everywhere you are at what times make it hard to be private at all!! To a certain extent, I was threatening to not ever use my phone so they wouldn’t know where I was at ALL! Although the idea of this app is great and could be successful, I feel that the app itself is not good, because teens should get their privacy, unless asked about what they are doing. Having the app on their phone reminds them that their parent is always watching and reviewing what they are doing, which can stop some people from doing enjoyable things during their teen years.

It’s hurting family relationships around the whole US. If anything use Find My, apples 1st party tracking software that doesn’t feel like such an invasion of privacy because it lacks features like drive detection and top speed alerts. As a teen, I want to be able to go to a friends house on my own and do what I want, WITHOUT being tracked. Our parents couldn’t be tracked when they were kids, and it’s not fair that they can track us. They were able to have fun during their high school years, while we don’t because they feel the need to be over protective. There is no good outcome from downloading this app. It just makes your last few years as a teen dreadful because you can’t do anything. Kids are actually more willing to run off with Life360 because of built up anger from it and I’m sure there have been suicide attempts as well.  Whatever you do, DONT DOWNLOAD.

"If anything, unsafe","As a teenager whose parents tracked her up until college, I can say wholeheartedly this app will do nothing but instill fear and distrust in your children. I broke my mother’s heart the day I had to look her straight in the face and tell her I didn’t trust her. The micromanaging will only cause a rift between you and your children such that, if something major were to actually happen, you’re the last person they’d want to turn to. And if emotional turmoil isn’t enough, putting a tracking app on your teenager’s phone will make it more likely that they leave their phone home or in an “acceptable” location while they sneak off and do what they like and in this situation, if something bad were to happen, not only would you be unable to track them, but they’d be unable to call for help. For years kids have found ways to work around helicopter parenting and you may be endangering them by fostering such a negative relationship. My relationship with my mom is fine now, but, if tomorrow I were to fall pregnant, lose all my money, get arrested, or find myself in a situation where I’m surrounded by guns/drugs/shady characters, I would not be calling her.

You don’t want someone listening in on you while the watch is lying on the table charging. These options should have separate on/off for each person and be controlled by designated primary caregivers. Plus the tracking is invasive as well. You want the person watching your child to be able to track them in case they get lost but you don’t want them to track her once shes picked up from her parents.

However, the only way to do that is to log out or delete the app. This app also promotes lack of trust, respect, and responsibility. When a parent creates a group, they add their children into the group. Once the kids are added, the parents can track their children 24/7.

The fact that a mom actually installed this app onto her son's phone without his knowledge is flat out wrong. Teens are supposed to do things their parents don't want them to do. If you're constantly monitoring your child 24/7, just imagine what your child will do when they go off to college. They'll go nuts with freedom.

Furthermore, tracking your kids every move can be damaging to the connection between a parent and a teenager. Your child will feel like they can’t be honest with you because of consequences. That will cause a lack of communication and lying on a teenagers part. Kids need to be allowed freedom without feeling like they can’t do anything because of overly protective rules. There is no reason to need to know where your child is every two seconds if you are that worried a simple text, “did you make it ... safely?” Will do just fine. You can’t just give all of the responsibility to your child the second they turn 18 they need to be allowed freedom so they can learn boundaries.

unnecessary,when parents force their child to download the app it damages the relationship between parent and child. it shows that the parents do not trust their own child and puts restrictions that become suffocating. sure if you ask your child if they want to download it and they agree to it then that's fine but if a person is forced to download the app there is a problem. due to the apps existence parents believe they have the right to track their childs whereabouts and it's scary how accurate it is sometimes.,Power,Free will,Visibility
Most Unnecessary App,For the creators of this app i want you to know that the only thing you are doing is ripping families apart.

This is stalking it is not “helpful” this makes parents trust their kids even less and makes kids want to sneak around more. Maybe if kids felt like they could trust their parents and not have to have an app tell their parents every step they take, life might be a little bit more bearable. Because of this app, i have not been able to go to bonfires or go to the mall with friends or have sleepovers because my mom has been so psycho about tracking how fast i go on the highway and why it took so long for me to get home after school bc i stopped at the gas, i have no social life. i rarely get the opportunity to leave the house besides school and work.

creepy,"literally something out of a sci-fi movie or 1984. Tracking software like this is all we have been warned about our entire lives, and now it’s being accepted under the guise of safety? Last time I checked, the parents requiring children to download this app survived just fine without someone constantly looking over their shoulder. The entire point of being a teenager is to explore the world and get to understand it before you actually move out. This app is just another ridiculous and frankly disturbing method for helicopter parents to screw up their children’s lives. By tracking them 24/7, kids will most likely be isolated from their friends and develop mental issues from this exclusion. And the main reason most parents get this app, the crash detection feature, must be paid for. The developers of this app are clearly just trying to profit off the suffering and social isolation this app causes teens, and clearly have some form of mental issue, superiority complex, or just enjoy seeing children suffer.

I’m talking about checking it every 10-20 minutes even when I’m doing something as innocent as going out for coffee or coming to and from school. 

When I go out my parents always freak out and question me on where I went and exactly what I did. It has made me distanced from them and made me feel like they don’t trust me at all. This app notifies your parents/family when you turn off the tracking and when you are stopped somewhere, even if you don’t want that setting to be turned on. It’s a violation of people’s privacy ESPECIALLY since I am close to being a legal adult.

 My sister is in college and over 18 and my parents still obsess over her location and driving every minute of the day, which implores me to ask every parent out there who wishes to download this app for that purpose, to be VERY wary of the privacy and trust boundary between you and your child/children. If you want your kid to be safe just ask them if they feel comfortable with this app or make them memorize some family members numbers. That’s what they’re for. That’s what this app is for.

There is a line that parents and children don’t cross, but this app allows parents to cross that line and monitor their children’s every move.  I find that because of this app, I’m refusing to live with my parents while attending university, because this app has created a reason for me not to trust my parents because they obviously do not trust me.  In the case of an emergency, I believe a person is able to contact whoever it might be in order to get help.

Invasion,"I can see how this app would be useful in either emergency situations or with people who have given reason not to be trusted (i.e. drug addicts, spouses who have been unfaithful, particularly bad kids etc. etc.) I can also see how it would be useful for young kids who sometimes have to walk alone to get to the bus stop. But for reasons other than I stated, it is an invasion of privacy as you can see a past history of where people have went, how they are currently driving (i.e. speed, what roads, if they have been on their phone or not) Hell there’s even a more extreme version where you can read texts and monitor social media activity. Once again the latter would seem reasonable for young children who are under 13, give or take. But in reality this is often used by controlling, overprotective parents who failed to build their child’s trust in them, so they had to use an app to do their job. This kind of app should only be allowed under special circumstances as all it does is damages parent to child communication, trust, and ultimately respect. If you are a parent who at all values what your child thinks of you. Do not get this app. By using this you automatically take all privacy from your children who already had little to begin with. This isn’t 1984 (the book). Being monitored is a complete violation of the trust and respect you have built with your child for the past however many years. Imagine how you would feel if you were forced to use technology similar to this by your parents in the 70’s or 80’s. You would likely feel betrayed, upset, or just generally not happy. I completely understand checking in on your older kids locations via a text or a call, but this takes it to the next level. If you really want to know where your kids are, just ask them like a normal person, don’t track them like a criminal. If you raised them right, they’ll be honest. Take it from one of the “children” who were forced to use this, rather than one of the moms who are both oblivious and ignorant to what their kid thinks.

This app is disgusting,"This application uses technology in the most disgusting way possible. Not only does this provide a platform for helicopter parents to become so over protective to the point it becomes an issue in the child’s life, but it is overly invasive. This app creates a vortex of invasion of privacy and a serious lack of trust. Parents become so involved in this app it takes “protecting their child” to another level. Parents don’t understand that when they were younger they had to freedom to participate in whatever they want, they were free to be teenagers. This app not only tracks a child’s every. single. movement. But it also tracks speeds, battery percentages, history of movements, device settings and more. This app is promoted to the public as a way to track children if they are hurt, or in a crash. But how many scenarios are actually like this. How many lives has this app actually saved? The app is causing a horrendous increase in mental issues among teenagers and younger children which in the future can cause more serious problems. Trust is broken between a young child and an parent. It is creepy, invasive and overall is a domino in today’s society’s downfall.

Invasion of privacy 😡,"This app has two uses. One being a way to see what your friends are up to, and another being a way to invade your kids privacy, and track their every move. I understand how this is a good way to track your kids phone if they are lost or during an emergency, but most parents use this too much and become power hungry. For example if I ask to go to McDonald’s, and my parents say yes, and then I decide to go to the gas station across the street, then I will be punished. Life was totally different before life 360 came along. Thankfully there are many location spoofing 3rd party apps on the internet, so there truly is no reason to download this app for spying on your kids. I’m not looking for any action or feedback from Life 360, but this is a fair warning for children and parents reading this. Life 360 can change the way you parent, and it could make your child feel like a prisoner. Please use this app with fairness and the child’s mental health in mind. A childhood where you can’t go to the gas station across from McDonald’s without getting tracked and punished is no childhood at all. Thank you.",Power,Free Will,Free will

Life360: a great way for your parents to scrutinize you,"Im guessing you people made this app because teens are no longer trusted people. And im not saying it works. Oh it works. If i go 36 in a 35 mile per hour for 5 seconds, life 360 “kindly” notifies my parents, so i can get yelled at on the phone. If I'm at school for a few minutes studying, life 360 will “kindly” notify my parents, so that i can get grounded from staying after school. If my battery on my phone is low, it will “kindly” notify my parents, so that i can be lectured for about an hour of how i am so useless in technology. 
Listen here. Life360 is only good for parents if they have actual bad kids. If parents cant even muster to control their kid, hey. Just use life360 and it can control the kids for the parents. Thats the art of lazy parental controls anyway.... whatever:  the thing is, i try to be a good kid. I try to use the freedom i have on good things. How can i be free to do good things if im being stalked constantly by life360? Its as if my parents are just gonna be at school or in the car, everyday, just scrutinizing me for everything i do now.
If this concept is supposed to be a safe way for children and parents alike, then there should be a strict quiz on parents, in an attempt to not criticize. If they want to stalk me for safety, go ahead. I wanna be safe. But if they want to know everything im doing at this moment, only to end up in judgement, this app cannot seem. I dont want a parent who is trafficing my freedom and stringly criticizing my life. I want an app that makes sure my parents only track me to see if im safe, to make sure that if im free, they are on my side.

distrust and dishonesty,"in middle school, my mother took my phone from me for two years until i purchased my own. at times she still threatens to take it away from me (and my car, which i also paid for including the insurance every month). i feel that it is completely unreasonable to demand such things from your child and should honestly be illegal. i’ve had this app for a little over a year now (it was the only way that my mom would allow me to have a phone again). i was forced to suffer through 8th grade and my freshman year of high school without a phone. as a 17 year old, having an app that keeps constant track of where i am/ what i’m doing it absolutely mind boggling. i was scrolling through reviews before finally deciding to write one myself and came across one where a woman explained a situation where Life360 saved her son. she began the story by stating that her son asked to skip football practice to do homework and she said no. the app showed that he wasn’t at his high school anymore so she proceeded to freak out and believed that someone was kidnapping him or that he had skipped practice. first, why would you not let your child stay home from practice to do homework? school always comes first. second, your son is at football practice and even if he isn’t, who cares. no ones mind should automatically go straight to the worst scenarios possible, especially not kidnapping. she proceeded to call the police but then realized that he was just practicing on a different field. how insane and psychotic do you have to be to call the police on your child who is at football practice, i understand that she was probably concerned, but she could’ve simply zoomed into the map to see that he was clearly playing on a different field. this is proof that this app feeds overprotective parents addictions of controlling their kids lives and knowing their every move. even if the app hadn’t updated, please, please, please trust your child. it is quite frankly an unnecessary app that is ruining your children’s/ child’s life(lives). if you wouldn’t have wanted your parents knowing all of the sneaky things that you were doing when you were a teenager, then why would we? seriously please consider having an actual trusting relationship with your child rather than micromanaging them. i promise it will improve overall trust and your kids will thank you. delete this app please.",Power,Free will,Visibility

unbelievable.,"what has become of this society? it seems that trust between parents and their children has been thrown away and just no longer exists. you’ll constantly hear complaints about how technology has taken over and how much better things were back in the day, when your parents were kids. but back then, there was no tracking, there were no security cameras all over houses, and kids could actually be kids and have fun. so if parents are so fond of life when they were young, why not keep all aspects of it the same? why track your child when you didn’t have to be tracked at their age? if you’re a parent, you’d be lying if you said you never rebelled, such as went to a high school party. but look—you’re still here and you’re fine. sometimes teenagers just want to have fun—it’s what happens. parents using this app obsess over and want to control their child’s every move in an effort to “protect” them. but having so many boundaries for teenagers isn’t doing any good whatsoever. it’s making them feel as if they’re locked in a cage and are unable to do anything as a result. making them feel trapped isn’t going to achieve anything except leave them desperate to escape, meaning they are more likely to act out and rebel. being so strict with children is only going to weaken the relationship with their parents. and this app creates the opportunity for that to happen. most of the reviews on here are written by very satisfied parents who are thrilled they can obsess over all their child’s actions, hence the 4.8 stars. but how about looking at the reviews of their children to see what this app really does.",Power,Free will,Visibility

This app is all about trust issues. My parents forced me to download this app. I trust my parents that they will always do the right thing. I believe they can go out with their friends, have fun, and be responsible. I believe they should have the same trust and respect in me. When I first saw the text  of them asking me to “join their life 360 circle” I saw it as almost disrespectful. It was like a slap in the face.

This app is basically a block to all of that. You cannot always monitor their life 24/7. You have to eventually learn to let go.

As a 19 girl whos never done anything wrong, this sort of thing broke my relationship with my parents from ages 13-17. If I wanted to be at someone’s house that they didn’t trust but had no reason not to, I would leave my phone somewhere else and if something had happened to me, I wouldn’t have had my phone to get help. Trust us because we’re smarter than you think and if we know somewhere or something will put us in a bad situation, we won’t do it. I went to college and went crazy just because I finally felt like I was able to. Rebelling and doing silly things is all part of being a teenager and having a silly app or forcing so much control over them WILL NOT help them in the long run. A teen will do what they want no matter what so wouldn’t you rather they know that they can trust you and come to you if they’ve had something happen to you? Stop forcing your own insecurities on you children. It’s abusive.",Free will,Power,Honesty

When teens are finally able to break free from this restrictive lifestyle, they are more likely to go out and do all the things they feel like they’ve missed out on. Life360 has destroyed my parents trust and my social life.

It blocks random websites and other things it has NO reason to! Second, if your child hates this it’s VERY simple to get rid of and or bypass. Please before you try to destroy your child’s device with this give it a thought!

This App is for Controlling Parents.. That's it.,"I'm not going to be very nice here, but please read this review if you're a parent that uses or is considering using this app for your children.

If you use this app, or anything similar (Life360 for example) you obviously don't deserve to have children.  

Quick question, what are you trying to accomplish? Does your child have bad grades, and you want to improve them? Is your child is misbehaving? Blocking apps won't do anything. Think of something else, their phone has absolutely NOTHING to do with it. Your child CLEARLY doesn't deserve to have a phone if you have to use apps like these (but that doesn't mean you should take their phone away, that would make them hate you even more)

I'd say you're a pretty sh*tty parent if you even CONSIDER using a controlling app like this for your child. YOU are the one that f*cked up when raising them, and YOU are the one that needs to fix it.

And parents wonder why.,"I’m here to say that this app breaks the trust with your child. I have a friend with anxiety, and the Internet helped distract herself from all that with online friends, YouTube, etc. She’s devastated and had to delete multiple apps *including* YouTube. She is older than 13, and this app alerts you when someone in text messages sends “inappropriate content” aka cursing. So for our one friend who does curse occasionally over text, it alerts them a *untrustworthy person* is texting them and they have the option to BLOCK THEM! Parents wonder why kids are depressed, they feel cut off and untrusted when these apps are installed. Parents also wonder why as kids get older, they become sneaky and try vaping and such and sneak out. They’re parents have made them feel so trapped because they want to keep them ‘safe’ instead of building trust with their child, that they want to bolt as soon as their old enough and try everything their parents “protected” them from. So parents, instead of blocking them from the outside world, try building trust with them so much that they can be HONEST with you and even learn from their mistakes. I know my parents never downloaded an app like this, they have my trust so I am willing to tell them what I’m doing. So here’s a tip, parents of the world: How about  building a relationship with your kid instead of hiding behind a screen to teach them lessons.",Power,Capacity,Statutes

It can be useful but you put to much power into one persons hand being able to manipulate how somebody behaves even when you are not there.

DANGEROUS APP!,"I loved this app at first. Our grown kids could see where we are as we drive long distances for our business. We could also see if we needed to call them at home or on their cellphones. It was comfortable and helpful, with four people involved. 
Then we wanted to add another of our kids who lives out of state. She got the app and sent us a request to join. Just before clicking accept, I read that it would create a permanent link between everyone on our group, with everyone on her group. 
That means that we would have an ever-expanding collection of people who may be friends or family members added by every person on our list. Knowing that there are some people in those categories that we really don't want to know our whereabouts, a sudden chill came with the creepy factor.

You can turn off people as an admin, but it's not clear if that takes you off the other person's list.

Teenager Worst Nightmare.,I agree with one of the reviews on here. I can understand if you use this app for maybe younger teenagers. But for people that are in Highschool ? Or even graduated?

You should also trust them enough to where you wouldn't even have to question when/where they're going out. This type of stuff is so annoying. If your child is in Highschool or graduated.

False Locations,"To be honest I never really liked this app in the first place because my parents use it as a way to watch what I’m doing every minute of the day. Especially since I moved out of their house for the reason that they are too overbearing and paranoid, this app is a disadvantage to a lot of kids. Not only does it not update your location as fast as possible but I’ve had a recent problem of it showing that I was some place else when rather I was 6 miles away from what the tracker was saying. 

Sorry but I feel that parents just use this app to their advantage because in most cases they only use trackers if they don’t trust their children. I’m almost 20 and my parents still threaten me to keep my tracker on even though I moved out for the very reason of not having to be watched.",Free will,Truth,Honesty
Funny,"Kinda hilarious how the developers respond to all the parents because they pay $25 to helicopter over a kid  but, when a teens point of view is mentioned they are ignored why? because they are the ones getting the down side effect of this app. The creators of this do not care if this app brings a prison like house hold or family trust issues mentioned in other reviewers posted I mean that’s kinda sickening. Someone needs to start a petition to get ride of this app purely on the fact it’s a invasion of privacy and practically “Microchipping” whoever installs this app. And one other thing is who knows what kind of data these creators have behind close doors this app provides them with your everyday movements, locations, speed, and even when your phone is low.

More harm than good so far,"This app is a nice idea in theory. I walk home from work, sometimes in the late evening. It gives my family members piece of mind.

I receive a robotic call telling me my mom needs help and that's all... I try to call her but of course she didn't hear her phone because she is in the shower. After panicked phone calls to family asking to check on her and teary anxiety attacks she finally calls me back and was none the wiser to what had happened. Another time my mother was mugged and the police call asking if I can track her phone to find the suspect. She had been mugged moments before and though the app was fully updated it didn't have a decent internet signal so there was nothing we could do. The last updated location was her work which she had been at the night before. Thanks but no thanks.",Honesty, ,Truth

ruining relationships?,"Hi I’m a teen and have had many conflicted thoughts about this app.  I understand the need for this app especially in the world we live in today, but I feel this app takes it too far.  Many other teens like myself haven’t done anything to jeopardize the trust bestowed upon us by our parents ,but it’s being questioned now due to this app.  Like mentioned in other reviews our parents did not have the tight leash we have today.  My freedom is so limited because of my worrisome parents.  I have been taught to always watch my surroundings and make sure i know what’s going on especially being a female, and trust me I do.  This app makes many teens feel their parents don’t trust them and i feel the same way.  This app tracks every move we make and if this app can who knows what else or who else is tracking us.  The hold on people that this app has with parents not just trusting their kid but forms the feeling of imprisonment.  Even when our parents were our age the world was still a bad place with many crimes happening but they had freedom to go with friends and not worry about getting text from there parents being told to come home because maybe they stopped to get food then we’re heading to the destination or being worried about getting yelled at because they forgot to text there parents that they stopped and already know they will get in trouble.

my (awful) experience with qustodio,"i’ve had qustodio downloaded on my devices for around a year or so. i have only just read other people’s reviews for the app, so i feel like sharing my experience.

to sum the first part up, i came out to my parents, and they thought i was influenced by the internet. and that’s when they got this god forsaken app. 
ever since then, i have been pulled out of school, and had my privacy invaded every. single. day. 
i was already having trouble with my identity and stuff, and this app made everything a million times worse. my parents blocked all my social media. ALL OF IT. i’m talkin discord, deviantart, youtube, everything. i am an artist. i express myself through art and i couldn’t share my art anymore. also, i usually vented to my online friends who could understand me. we voice chatted, and i had such a good relationship with them. they were not creepy old guys trying to kidnap me. i lost them. i lost all my online friends because of this app. i lost my spaces where i could post about my feelings and feel safe. I DO NOT CARE IF IT WAS PUBLIC, IT WAS MY SPACE. (i didn’t share my address or anything, just my feelings n stuff). they sent me to a therapist, mind you, so don’t say that i should just talk to a therapist. that therapist belittles my problems and just tells me “god knows what’s right for u!!!!1!1!” like literally no actual advice or anything. just bible verses. (sorry that part wasn’t very important,,,,)
i felt that i suffered alone. i felt cut off from the entire world.
“well, you should be used to this now, right? you’ve had it for about a year now!”
yes! i am! i have grown completely numb to almost all of it.
it’s so mentally draining, knowing that my parents are always watching me. i’m so paranoid that i’ll do something wrong, even on accident and not just on the internet. i feel like everyone around me (well, there’s not really anyone around my anymore) is growing up and finding out who they are, and i’m just watching from a distance, wishing i was doing the same. 
i am a teenager now, and i understand that parents just want us to be safe. but guess what! congratulations! you have officially made your child develop trust issues, unable to grow social skills, and have them never tell you anything again. good job!

look. i’m fine with the time limits, because sleeping is important when a teen is growing. but please.

teens want to keep in contact with their friends and search for new ideas and educate themselves, or just for entertainment. checking in on them is still good, like i get it if u don’t want them watching porn or getting on dating apps. but do not go through their messages. do not keep a microscope on them at all times. 

we are kids. let us grow. we’re not 4 years old anymore, sorry.

i feel safe rambling about this here, because there are kids my age that are in the same situation, and if you are one of those kids, you’re not alone. one day you’ll get that app. one day you can text someone without your parents knowing the exact subject. you will not be controlled by them. stay strong, i love u.

Hiya,"{This applies more to ages 13+}Though this is a good app for monitoring your kids screen time, the app basically tracks your child’s every move and gives them no freedom and no room to grow.

TRUST YOUR KIDS A LITTLE MORE. Trust they will make better decisions. Sit them down and explain to them how you feel before getting this app. Try having a meaningful conversation where you don’t display your dominance nor threaten them in any way and maybe they will not only trust you more but they might actually listen to you.

How will kids learn and be responsible if everything they do is monitored and judged! I’m up for keeping children safe from scams and stuff but COME ON! Kids have to learn boundaries some how! Also I got into my mothers email and my “activity review” had a bunch of apps and games including TikTok,insta,Snapchat, and Facebook, episode, bitlife, transformers,fort nite and I COULD GO ON- when I have never even downloaded or played ANY of these!and it said that I had played it which got me in trouble😤  and as for blocking inappropriate websites- I saw porn adds fully visible and my school website WAS BLOCKED! This is a mess! Honestly this is the worst thing to do to get trust between you and your kid. I despise my parents knowing that they don’t trust me enough to be put on a baby “supervisor” that doesn’t even work! Lay back on your kids and have a discussion as equals! And not motherfreaking kings and queens! This tore my family apart and as my parents refuse to take it off, is not glueing it back! I, and I can speak for many other children around my age, ARE NOT FREAKS WHO LOOK UP PORN AND GROSS STUFF! And tho many parent won’t believe...kids have minds if their own and it is not a parents right to judge what they think or what they are going to do! So please, just talk openly with your families before getting this, it is not worth blocking inappropriate sites but ruining your family.

If you don’t let them have mistakes they will never learn.

App is counterintuitive,"Tagging and location tracking is for livestock, not people.

This app simply should not exist, not only does it allow for parents to essentially have a personal satellite to watch their family, but also makes it impossible for children to make their own mistakes and learn from them. The way a child will learn is from making mistakes, this app doesn’t allow a child to make those mistakes and learn to correct them, but rather to find a work around for the tracking. Life 360 doesn’t allow them to fit into society as a child or do anything wrong when they’re young enough to make these mistakes. Your child will get one time to be a child in their life, its unfair to use this app and take away their ability to live during that childhood before they have to strictly follow the rules of society.

Absolutely horrible app.,"Please please Qustodio, add a disclaimer or SOMETHING that says that this app should be for at least 16 and under. People who use this app to monitor anyone older than that are extremely manipulative, controlling and creepy.

I get it; if pornography or cheating is your main concern, you can add router settings to block those sites, or you can communicate with your partner. However, straight up recording text messages, ALL internet history, searches, and app usage is just wrong. Anyone above 16 doesn’t need to be monitored by this app. They are not “children.” They are people. Stalking their internet usage is not right and a violation of privacy. Want your “child” to be a paranoid mess later in life? Want your “child” to be even more secretive towards you because they already know their every move is being monitored closely? If so, then get this app. It’s the perfect app to cause issues later in life!

DO NOT USE THIS APP ON PEOPLE 17 AND UP. I can see why you’d use it on anyone younger than that. I’d personally use it on someone 6-14. But you have to realize, people aren’t always going to be immature. They will grow up into ADULTS. Adults do NOT NEED THEIR EVERY MOVE MONITORED. It’s an EXTREME VIOLATION of privacy and is without a doubt controlling and abusive. Please. It will cause anxiety problems, trust issues and even more secretiveness from the person being monitored.  Don’t use this app on people 17 and up. That’s not what it’s for. 

This app also has a myriad of issues. It will destroy internet connection sometimes, app/music downloads, stops phone updates completely unless it’s taken off, and will report things that haven’t happened.

•this is an open gate for stalkers and kidnappers who pretend to be other people just to get close to you
•if you are a public figure/ youtuber, all the people (majority that you DON'T KNOW) will immediately know where you are.

don’t recommend,"For parents getting this game... This app is great for making sure your teens are not in an accident, but that’s about it. Teens will make mistakes. They take their high school years to learn. Honestly, your teens aren’t gonna learn many lessons if you’re always tracking them down on this app. Let them learn from their consequence of speeding and so what if they go a slightly different route then where you told them to go. When your teens are finally “old enough” to where you no longer track them, they will have so much freedom it could make them reckless. Without YOU no longer tracking them they will feel powerful and rebellious and will likely conclude in an accident/mistake. And no, you don’t prevent that event from occurring by tracking your teen till the day you die, but by not getting the app at all.

Before this app, I just texted my parents when I got to or left a certain location. This app has ruined my college experience. Whenever I am out late or out with my boyfriend, my parents ask me a million questions about what’s going on. I tell them everything and I never hide anything, but now they think everything I say is a lie, even though I haven’t given them a reason not to trust me. It has ruined my relationship with them. We used to be close and now I want to live as far from them as possible. It’s like I can’t breathe. I have no social life at home and it’s because of this app. I also started to go to therapy because of this. The app made me feel like I’m not trusted and like every move I make is wrong. In my developmental psychology class, my professor asked who has strict parents and I raised my hand and I told her about this app and her jaw dropped. She couldn’t imagine having your college aged kid having this app! Same with everyone else in my class! One day, my location turned off and my parents texted me and asked why did I do it and what I am hiding.

Review from a 19-year-old college student being tracked,"Please, if you want your children to develop trust with their parents, do not get this app. My mother downloaded this overnight when I was 13. For the past 6 years I’ve been subject to random checks of my location and driving speed. Between the ages of 13-15 it was fine, my mom could have peace of mind about me getting to and from school safely especially if a friend she didn’t know all that well was driving me home. Then when I turned 16 (this is all on the free version BTW), my mother would ask me why the app showed I went 40 when the fastest I should have gone was 35. At this time, the app wasn’t precise about the speed so I would get yelled at for speeding I didn’t do. As I grew up, I got more confident in my driving and would go about 4-5 miles over the speed limit. I would get texts about it all the time and be threatened with loss of keys for the weekends. This all I got used to, I wasn’t a bad kid, I didn’t skip school or go to parties in high school or even drink- I was trustworthy and told my parents everything. Sadly, I got to college and my mother kept tracking me. She would make sure I got to class on time/at all and then question where I was if I wasn’t on campus. My mom called me (indirectly) a slut because I spent the night at a guy friends house because I didn’t want to buy an uber in a city alone as a girl at 3am. This is when I knew this app was the devil (idk how I didn’t before...). My dad came to my college to drive me home for spring break and he showed up at my friends place to offer me a ride home- he used my location and guessed the correct building and got past the gate of the community. If I delete the app I will not be funded to go to school any more, I’m planning on getting a job and waiting until the education savings account runs out so I can sign my own loans and delete the app. This app is making me take on thousands in student debt just because I want privacy (as my parents offer to take out a parent loan). I delete the app just so they don’t know I miss class one day and want to go to Bojangles instead. I’m not able to grow up with this app on my phone.

all people make mistakes right?  well these people make a big one. they don't watch the videos and just think by the title, person, type of video, and video thumbnail. there could be nakedness, inappropriate language, and so much more.

I really liked it...at first, now it is more annoying than anything and it could use a few features.

For example my daughter was at her dads house, but the app kept telling me she was at the park one minute and then at her dads and went back and forth all day. Which leads me to the first fix/update is allowing you to get closer to the marked location than 250ft. I have also had the app tell me that my husband was located in a field going 5 miles per hour, when he was sitting across from me the entire time. How does that work? 🤔 Another feature I would love to see is if you are with a person, I.e. I am with my daughter, you shouldn’t get an alert that they left or arrived. I am with her I know she left, if it could detect that people were together it wouldn’t send alerts until they were away from each other.

It would be fine if I left it on younger in the settings and if my son was two, but this show (which looks like the main character is twelve instead of a toddler like he should be) is not meant for anyone older than four. And I don’t know about anybody else, but I wouldn’t want my seven year old son to be watching that crap and then acting that way in public. So I blocked the video and told him to stop watching it, and then an update happened and my kid was suddenly watching the same thing again. Not a day goes by when I get a call from my son’s teacher saying that somebody called a name, and it wasn’t even that bad, and she said that he through a tantrum, started stomping on the floor, crying, yelling, and he threw a book across the room, just like the main character did in caillou.

I was appalled with this app. My daughter downloaded onto her iPhone before I realized she was using it. Made her sign me in to her account on my iPhone so I could monitor her. This site is dangerous. It uses locator which will allow anyone to locate your child based on their posted pics. She constantly got texts from men who were obviously not 14 and also from men who were acting like they were 14 again it was obvious. This network has no parental controls and no safety features. It also accesses contact list and can track user through the contact list.

Without the VPN connected, (and it automatically disconnects constantly) the monitored device is incapable of doing pretty much anything.

PLEASE READ,"Alright so I have no problem with this apps concept and what it is meant to do, but I do have a problem with some features. I had no objection to my mom installing this on my phone and iPad because there’s nothing that I do that would get me in trouble with her. The first day after she installed it she received a notification of me going to a blocked website which I had never heard of. This was two years ago and still today she is receiving block website alerts for sites I have never visited, even according to my search history (incognito is too slow for me to even use 😂 which pertains to my next issue). The VPN is impossible to shut off. I don’t need protection on my home network or my friends networks, I would like to be able to use my WiFi (generally slow compared to others) to its full extent without having to wait 5 minutes to load eBay. In the daily reports, my mom receives notifications of me using apps which have never even been downloaded onto any of my devices (Facebook Instagram Snapchat... but only social media’s? Maybe to make they’re reports seem more genuine when they contain fake website visits or maybe family’s that have really messed up kids??) and I have gotten into trouble many many times over this and lost privileges because of nothing. Now here are my main two problems. The text reading and location. These two should not be integrated into a parental safety app, these are developed for parents who don’t trust they’re kids, whether or not they have a reason is unknown. The location isn’t as bad as the texts these are supposed to be generally private, granted you are writing something down but it is only SUPPOSED to be seen by yourself and the person you are sending it too. Imagine trying to have a conversation with your Girlfriend/Boyfriend knowing your parents are going to read the whole thing. Not easy I’m sure. Thankfully my mom “trusts” me enough to not use these features but how can you say you trust your child when they’re beyond the age of general ignorance and innocence (about 11 to 12 in this day and age) and still monitor all they’re activity online. For younger kids the features are great but for teens it’s just a device for parents who don’t trust they’re children, even the ones who have no reason, like my mom.

Not Suitable for Young Teens,"Look, I don’t want to rain on anyone’s parade, however there is an inherent problem with KIK. Its not suitable for young teenagers (like my daughter).

Its one thing if you are older, mature and can handle this, its another thing if you are a young and impressionable.   I’m not sure this problem will go away - the anonymity inherent with this app is one of its greatest draws, and to parents like me, a drawback.

As stated in previous reviews I’ve read, many people have issues with apps going everywhere after the device is unblocked. There’s a fix; put everything in folders from the app and leave it there. Ta da. You guys are innovative when it comes to this app, I won’t lie. 

However, there are some major loopholes and exploits, easy to be found if you’re looking. I won’t list them here, but the list is extensive. If you’re gonna make an app to restrict children from making mistakes/learning lessons (depending on which side of the fence you’re on), then at least make it more foolproof. 

I don’t appreciate the way the app empowers gung-ho parents to use it at times, and the limitless power it wields seems a bit too far-reaching. For instance, this app can essentially lock down my entire phone if desired, except for the phone app that is (that’s illegal everyone). 

Bit of a rant here, so I digress. From a parents standpoint, it’s effective. A warning though: don’t overuse it. Everything in moderation; it’s a tool, not a guillotine. Your children will hate you if you misuse it.

Yes, I have been through all of those situations. They are not pleasant. Even worse, the app taunts you about it. Even when your phone is shut off, the texts you receive will pop up on the screen, but you can’t respond to them. Then if your phone is locked, basically the only app that is on is the Our Pact Junior, and a message pops up in it saying, “You will have free time tomorrow.” I mean, how much more cruel can you get? I’m hoping this low review will discourage others from installing this horrible app, and I’m wishing upon my lucky star that the developers will wipe this app into oblivion.

If you think that this isn’t going to distance you and your child you are wrong. Sorry but it’s true. At least take this into account when you install it so you are not all surprised when your kid is keeping secrets from you.

First off, sometimes parents will accidentally hit a button that will mess up the cycle of the apps turning on and off so that the kids have full usage of their phone all day. It is going to happen. Your child IS NOT going to tell you that something happened. They will sneak off somewhere, maybe claim that they are reading or something, when in reality they are taking advantage of this mistake. It really is like a present. A present they aren’t going to want to return. They know that as soon as you find out you are going to take it away.

Also, when the apps ARE on, they probably are not going to want to do anything but be on their device. So when you tell them to do homework or chores during what they feel like should be THEIR time, they aren’t going to be happy. Instead of decreasing the amount of time spent on their phones daily, it is going to increase the time spent on their phones during the little bit of time they can be.

I personally don’t know anybody else who has this on their phones, so it can be frustrating when I am with my friends and they are doing something on their phone, but I can’t. It is honestly kind of embarrassing. It made me wonder why other parents seemed to trust their kids more than my parents trust me. 

So parents, you can take this as just another spoiled kid isn’t this generation who is just ticked off that she can play candy crush for 8 hours straight, or you can seriously take my opinion into account.

I can’t look up hot fudge recipes ( I guess because of the word hot 🙄) I cant look up anything with the word teen in it (Teen bedroom ideas, rooms to go teen, pottery barn teen, teen birthday party ideas, etc.) Many websites which I and my parents know are perfectly safe are blocked and there is no way for them to unblock them! Some things pop up and say “This website is restricted. Click here to ask for your parents permission to visit.”
And other times something pops up that says something about “phishing” and you also have a choice to ignore that. But other times it will just say RESTRICTED with no options at all. And this is the WORST PART: Sometimes I will go on a website which I used to be able to visit, and it will pop up and say: “CANNOT OPEN THE PAGE BECAUSE THE ADRESS IS INVALID” THAT HAPPENS SO OFTEN!!!!

YouTube needs to go through all the children’s shows and flagged or not and remove all the shows with the character in it. I would go as far as to say YouTube needs to shutdown the app temporarily and do a sweep of all the content to make sure this problem gets fixed.

Kids can get around it,"What should be front and center in the description of this app, with all of its wonderful features, is that (on iOS) the child can delete their OurPact profile in settings and the app will cease to function.

It’s as if they said we will babysit your children and play games with them and feed and bathe them and keep them safe, but if they choose to open the door and run away there is  nothing we can do to stop them. (And by the way, if your child chooses to run away from the babysitter perhaps that is a problem with your parenting?) So take all of these wonderful features with a grain of salt.

"Ok, but lose visibility of your child.","The idea behind ScreenTime is pretty solid, like all the other apps out there for managing the time your child spends on their devices. It does that pretty well.

The real problem for us has been simple, but serious.

If you &#34;block&#34; the kids with ScreenTime during School hours, which is part of the app, the child's GPS stops sharing their location.

If the run out of screen time, the sharing of their location is blocked by ScreenTime.

Our kids don't get a bus, and walk home from school, I think  they used to call us &#34;latch key kids&#34; when we were that age and walking home.

They cross streets, and they often walk alone. Not babies anymore, but still young, impressionable kids doing many things independently for the first time. 

While we live in a nice place for sure, suffice it to say no place is quite &#34;Mayville&#34; anymore. At least if you read the news.

So we would check in to make sure they were getting home timely, using iOS's &#34;Find My Friends&#34; app. Simple, and it worked to &#34;see&#34; them heading home.

We weren't &#34;obsessive&#34; about this, but this was a great benefit and piece of mind, knowing where the kids were no matter what, especially if there was any type of emergency situation --or if we just wanted to meet him after he started walking. 

Pretty much every parent is doing &#34;FindMy Friends&#34; with their kids. We share our locations with the kids too. They like knowing where we are too especially if I'm on a business trip, they follow my progress, and send texts. Very cute.

Since they sell to concerned parents, it is only fair that they acknowledge this up front. 

They _were_ however  upfront that they won't be fixing this, as they say say they can't.

Bummer for us, to say the least.

Microsoft and Amazon already have already released 'screen time' control apps. Microsoft's is awesome and free (only works on MS products --but includes xBox, phones, tablets and PC's)

Apple too is expected to follow, and create their own screen time type app too.  You won't need a third party app if and when they release this as an iOS feature.

Since I paid for a year, and used for only weeks before discovering this problem, &#34;Sam&#34; from ScreenTime was pretty good about explaining how to get a refund from the App Store and emailed a link explaining how to do it.

Hope this is helpful to other parents.

This App does not work - it needs to be accurate and tamper-proof.,"Location disconnects frequently!  I am increasingly alarmed by the vulnerability of this App - and thus the ability to safeguard the minor child using his smart iPhone. The Location on the child’s phone regularly breaks down and is this useless.  I cannot reconnect.  It is being tampered with and disconnected, even though I have restrictions on and locked on the child’s phone.  And the restrictions I set in this App do not work! My grandson is 11 and has an iPhone. I needed a way to communicate with him and track his location as he plays in the neighborhood and park near bye. I also realized that we needed a way to control Internet access and social media use. This App sometimes helps a lot.  It is still being developed, so I am patient.  However, the failure of the LOCATION feature is increasing. As a retired teacher, I am increasingly aware of how much youngsters can access on phones, tablets, and computers. Wise adults will take the time to monitor the children in their care and limit access to Internet and apps. And, wise adults can observe how the phone is used and who their child is interacting with.  This App is indispensable. Thank you! Now, please make it tamper-proof. This is alarming. I cannot access his phone to reconnect because he travels frequently. This App thus provides false “safety” service and is thus a waste of money - and a potential threat to the safety of children and families who rely upon it (and pay about $10 per month) to have the full Verizon Family Service. Please fix this software App - or withdraw it from the market. The App is consistently failing / and no one at Verizon can tell me why.  It is thus a serious safety hazard.",Truth,Honesty,Capacity

"Awful app, furious!!!!!!","First of all, this app “Call Recorder - Int Call”, which has an icon of a gray background and a phone emoji with a red dot to indicator record, and “TapeACall,”  which has an icon of a black, with a gray circle and a smaller red circle inside the gray circle, are the same flipping app and absolute TRASH. 

I am so livid I could break something, because when I needed this app to work, after testing it multiple times with my husband to ensure not only that it works, but that I knew how to use it properly, it did not work!!!!!!!

Unrelated to app but I need to vent:  I unfortunately have a mentally abusive mother who must ALWAYS be the victim, no matter the circumstances. She is cruel, and only stopped being physically abusive when I started fighting back. Child protective services were in our life for a long time, because it was my “fault” and that if I wanted to make things better I’d better lie and say how great things were otherwise my siblings would all hate me (according to her). I was told decades ago by professionals as well as friends and extended family to sever ties permanently, but for reasons unknown even to myself, I’ve continued to try and keep some kind of relationship. I forgave to the extent I was able, and I’ve tried to understand she is mentally ill. I’m married now, with my own children, who are being raised in a very loving, secure, nurturing, and peaceful environment. The other day my 14 year old son overhead her venom on the phone with me before she hung up on me for no good reason, after screaming at me when I’d done nothing wrong at all, only wanted my sister to visit if she was free. He knows a little about my childhood, but not much. He was angered by her treatment towards me. He wanted to call and tell her that I am not hers to torment, that he doesn’t want her near us if that’s what she is even kindasorta like. He ultimately did not, I explained not to let my experiences and feelings affect how he feels about his grandmother - she loves him and treats him decently (visits are few and far between, and me or hubby are always present) and that’s all he need be concerned with. But he’s smart. I think he knows more about my childhood than what I’ve told him. My sister ultimately came over, and she witnessed what I can only describe as a deeply profound moment between mother and son, that had us both bawling and him saying he is happy when I am happy. My sister told my mother she had upset my son but left out any parts my mother could’ve potentially twisted to convince herself that she’s the ever perpetual victim. 

It’s been a few days, my mother shockingly called to apologize. I missed her call but returned it. I accepted her apology, despite her insincerity. Of course she still managed to accuse me of putting lies into my son’s mind to turn him against her. I tried explaining that wasn’t the case at all, that she was distorting something she didn’t understand let alone have the story about. Lies, venom, accusations. I expected after accepting her apology that we would discuss because I like to make sure everyone walks away from a situation on the same page! I wanted to record the conversation for various reasons, one being for my own reference, the manipulation and tactics she uses time and time again. I know ultimately there’s nothing to be gained but more heartache, but it was something I wanted to do. So as she sat there berating me about involving my son to turn him against her because I’ve always been out to destroy her life (that’s why she spent most of my childhood telling me in graphic detail one of her biggest regrets was not aborting me and having me “ripped to pieces”,) to the point that telling others doesn’t even bother me - she said it so often when I was a teen that I’ve been numb to it for well over 20 years. I had my reasons for wanting to record what she had to say, and her mental gymnastics , her justifications and mad ranting...and this app failed to capture any of it!!! I did what I was supposed to, and double checked, and afterward, there was nothing but the first 15 seconds!!!!! 

Going back to this worthless app, besides not liking needing to call a number and do it as a conference call and merge, when placing an outgoing call, anyone also using a smart phone has a high likelihood of knowing something is off.

Teens want their freaking privacy back,"If thousands of families have already broken mine is on the chopping block because whoever decides to install this app onto a teen’s phone probably has worse trust issues than a hero and villain working together in a movie, comic or something else. It’s bad enough that I didn’t have much freedom to start with before this app was installed onto my phone, this makes any household turn into North Korea in terms of freedom and gives teens KGB levels of lack of privacy. If I wanted to name historical figures who would endorse this app I would say, in order from oldest to newest, Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Mao Zedong, Kim Jong Il, and Kim Jong Un, and also 1800’s plantation owners. Come on people, if we fought for our rights to free expression, free worship, privacy, arms, and so on, why have we degraded to violating some of those rights with this app? I’ll tell you why, because parents nowadays feel like their child is as delicate as a snowflake and have to monitor their every move so they think they would be able to help in the event of a crash from miles away when it’s really just a helicopter parent app that leads to resent and even worse trust issues. I wish this app could just be removed, it’s sickening seeing that this is in the top 5 on social networking. Us teens want to have some independence and freedom from the Big Brother in our parents. Parents, teens, and children alike, why do we allow this helicoptering? Why do we allow this nail in the coffin of a family relationship? Why is this the reason a family relationship gets put on the chopping block? What is it with modern parents thinking they’re helping their teen’s driving when really it’s just creating a bigger divide than the wealth gap of Los Angeles where the homeless see 100k+ cars drive by on the regular? To all the teens scrolling through the reviews I say we organize a protest against this app and it’s prison-like household atmosphere it creates. To all the parents reading this, I hope your child’s cell is comfortable. To the developers, I say, delete this app off the store or pray to Stalin that you can keep this going for much longer. To my parents, If you find this, I hope you’re happy with being one of the sole reasons for the degradation of your 15 year old son’s mental health.

"Expensive, buggy, 100% unhelpful","ScreenTime Labs' Apple app is full of bugs with no real fixes, and is almost guaranteed to frustrate all parties involved, as their website also provides little to no helpful advice for both the parent version and the child version. It is labelled here as free, but in reality will tell you upon installation that it requires monthly payment to function.

As for offered services, the only relatively &#34;useful&#34; feature is the daily time limit. It only counts how much time the screen is on for, not which app is being used. It also counts the 5 seconds when the lock screen lights up from incoming notifications, which is a considerable annoyance. It doesn't, however, count time used listening to music with the screen turned off. That one easy get-around can potentially add hours to your child's time limit (if they're a music lover) and therefore render this feature entirely useless.

Aside from the constant technical malfuntions, it will only fuel a negative environment surrounding your child and their phone; they may begin to see you as controlling or overbearing, assuming they don't already. They may become anxious about notifications turning their screen on when they aren't using the device, or even just about using their phone in general. 

At that point, why would they have a phone at all? They aren't using it to its full potential. You aren't allowing them to. Why waste your money on this &#34;service&#34; when you could simply take the device away? If you are looking at this app as a last-resort-type attempt to get your kids to spend more time with the family, look elsewhere. Maybe try inside yourself; there's clearly a much deeper problem if nothing you've done so far to bring your teenager back to ~family time~ has helped.",Power, ,Visibility

Do not recommend.,"I can see why parents would think this app is great for keeping track of their children especially in their teen years but I have some points to prove. First of all this app is kind of scary, you can see what room you are in when you are at home it shows what side of the house you are on and also if you are a student at school it shows what class and what part of the school you are in too. This app also shows lots of details of your house like what color your house is, if you have a deck and what color it is you can even see a basketball net!! How is that acceptable? Another reason is because if your child is over the age of 13 years old you would think it’s good to have a tracker on them right? But no not always they might feel trapped and like they won’t have any fun. When you were a kid did you have  to worry abt this... no I don’t think so, so why do it to them?

DONT GET THIS APP!!,"I had my daughter get this app and i’ve never felt worse in my life. I broke the trust she thought she had with me by invading her privacy in such an intense way.

This was also terrible for the mental health of my daughter. I knew she had depression before but after this app it got a lot worse. She felt disconnected from me because i betrayed our trust and the disconnection from any contact with her friends through social media made her feel even more lonely and left out.

Offenders have rights also.,"This application is a disgusting attempt to profit from the broiling political atmosphere around these offenses and offenders.  It cannot serve to keep our children any safer than the instructions we give them in the context of our parenting. What this program, like the registry that preceded it, actually does is incite hateful and discriminatory behavior against all of those who are actively predatory AS WELL as those who made honest errors of judgement AND those who have effected change in their lives.  I don't want to be the person this app, and many of the reviewers, encourage me to be. Relative distance from and concentration of sex offenders won't enable us to pick up and move, nor can it keep sex offenders away, but it can and will affect our treatment of those around us.

Needs lots of work.,"With the resources and talent Google/YouTube have, it's really a shame that they don't try harder to protect our children that use their app.
- We need heavier filters. Age delineations isn't enough. We need deeper filters to cut out half the garbage our children find so easily.
- Keywords/Phrase blocking needs to be put in place. We should be able to type in words or ideas we don't want our children exploring &#34;by accident&#34;.
- Content should be vetted better. These fake videos disguised with cover photos that mislead our children to watching Peppa Pig get cut up or see other children or cartoons in questionable situations needs to stop.
- We should be able to block whole channels.

This is the tip of the iceberg. Come on YouTube. I'm not alone in the masses that want to protect our children's minds and keep their imaginations clean and clear. We do not rely on this app &#34;all day&#34;, but when it is offered as a treat and we ended up spending half of the viewing time switching shows or looking for clean content, you're allowing your app to fail and no one is being held responsible.

Don’t buy if your child is tech savvy!!!,I bought the premium version and put it on all 5 devices that my 8 and 12 yr old have access to. I chose this one because it is supposedly tamper proof.

He even had requests for nude pics from a supposedly 13 yr old girl!

From the POV of a teen,"Of course, the developers take time and answer every adult’s reviews (read: everyone with a “valid opinion”), and they won’t answer mine or the other teen POV review I’ve seen. Why do you block camera? Why do you block Siri? Also, I saw a review that said it was less about control and more of an agreement between the parent and the child. My parents do not operate like that. They took my phone for a month and when I got it back they had installed OurPact. They leave it blocked all day, every day (except for school, so I can use google classroom and such, but the second I get back home, blocked again). I do not understand why you have to make us pay to select certain apps to block, because I know that if my parents could, they’d let me keep camera, Siri, google classroom, WhatsApp, and apps like that all the time. But since they don’t pay for apps, I’m stuck with “all or nothing” and it’s gets very frustrating than my phone can’t function like a normal phone for 90% of a day.

Should this app exist? Morals of this app?,"The purpose of this app is to allow parents to keep an eye on their children and their whereabouts. If you look at other reviews, you can see children and teenagers single staring this app. I don’t think the reason they gave the app a bad review is because they are delinquent or immature, I think they see it as a loss in freedom and free will. Think about it! If your child wanted to go have sex with someone and they knew they had this app on their phone; would they bring their phone to the affair? The answer is NO they wouldn’t. This app dose nothing from stopping delinquency; the reason most parents use this app. Childhood is about learning and teaching your child to be a functioning adult, children only learn by making mistakes and bettering themselves from said mistakes, with the best way being their own mistakes so they can self evaluate and improve. This app tells the parents about every move their child makes; and makes the parents restrict the freedom of their child from making mistakes and basic human error. With the download of this app comes a fantastical idealism of what the parents want their child to be. That idealism depersonalizes the child damaging their trust with their parent. 

If a parent really wanted to help their child prepare for the real world, they would not get this app, Because once the child is presented with this app they think their parents don’t trust them, lowering their psychological well-being around their family life. Trust goes both ways between the parent and the child, and they are both needed for a healthy relationship. This app gets in the way of that!!! It comforts the parent to know where/what their child is doing, while restricting the child's freedom and experience from the world and damaging the Parent-child bond. 

Childhood is about the child's freedom and expression to learn important experiences needed for the real world after High School. If children are uncomfortable with this app, what are they learning? The best way to improve yourself is self evaluation and criticism; it is what teaches people right from wrong. So if you are planning to get this app for your child ask yourself these questions!!!

Is my child a delinquent?

Will this teach my child anything important about life? If so what and how is it important?

Will this help my child? 
*Think Psychology 

Will this help me as a parent teach and nurture my child about the real world?

Do I really need this app? 
Or will it make me create a grudge against my child?

Will this make or rise possible conflict and arguments with my child? 

Do i care about my family bond with my child/children and their opinion of me as a parent?

If you are thinking about getting this app understand that all the advertising shows a perfect happy family... Realistically this app creates the opposite affect... Give your child a chance to live a life without you stalking them, because the biggest problem with is app is the child it is intended for, but the parents doubts and idealisms; which are guaranteed to fail if they make their children get this app...

Needs some serious Improvements,"THE GOOD:
This is a good app if you would like to locate, filter data/web content and games for your child. You can see phone numbers of receiver/recipients for phone calls & texts.  Some minor improvements to these functions can make this app great. When the location on the app isn’t working properly, it shows you where your child is within a 1/2-1 mile radius.  If you live in the NYC area, it looks like your child can be in a different borough.  I live in Queens and some times the app shows me that my child is either in the Bronx or Manhattan.  I can’t begin to tell you the anxiety I feel.

THE BAD:
Pairing the child’s phone can be challenging when your teen won’t let you physically take their phone or give you their passwords to install app or install it themselves.  When you want to pair the child’s phone, the app sends a text to the child/teen with instructions.  If you manage to pair your child’s phone and your child decides they don’t want this app anymore, all they have to do is simply delete the app, disable the VPN, and Location, or reset phone.

DO NOT USE THIS APP OR APPS LIKE IT!!!,"I don’t use this app, however my wife works as a medical alarm monitoring center operator. She gets emergency signals from this app’s crash detection feature that fires off way too often in non-emergency circumstances because stupid parents put the app on their kids’ phones and don’t understand what its doing. Then their stupid teenagers get called by my wife to make sure they’re okay and they’re downright rude and disrespectful because there was nothing wrong in the first place.

Shaking your phone is a common gesture that shuffles songs or performs other functions. That makes a crash detection feature for phones pointless because it will fire more under common phone use-cases or when someone just tosses their phone down than for actual emergencies. If you need crash detection, get Onstar. This app causes false-alarms to where authorities are needlessly dispatched.

And when my wife gets these emergency signals that she is forced to send dispatch to, dispatch gets angry when she cannot give them a name or vehicle description because the owner of the app didn’t give all their necessary information in the app to send along with the crash signal. So how are authorities supposed to get to your kid?

One instance my wife mentioned was a girl’s phone, with this app, sent a crash signal while she was on a school bus. But the bus hadn’t crashed. Even if the authorities get an initial GPS location for your child, how are they supposed to locate them if they don’t have a vehicle description and they don’t see a crash anywhere?

So 3 things:

•First of all, your kids are teenagers. (If they’re not, they’re too young to have a phone!) They're old enough to make some of their own decisions. They don’t need to be tracked everywhere they go. Think about it before you waste money on this.

•This app wastes tax-payer dollars sending emergency services to a site where there’s no emergency because the crash detection is too sensitive and unreliable and doesn’t provide vital info to locate the person. Get real crash detection from OnStar in your car if you really need it. Microchip your child if you’re that worried about their location or physical well-being.

•If you just HAVE to use this service, make dang sure you put in all your family names and vehicle descriptions and such in so that when operators like my wife get a crash signal from your kid’s phone, they can ACTUALLY find your kid and help them.

This is not to bag on the company who runs this app. I’m just giving you the real truth of what goes on when people download this thing willynilly and don’t understand what it actually does.

But the app’s emergency service does need to be improved drastically or removed entirely. Phones are not good crash detection sensors due to more common use scenarios that use the same movement and because phone motion sensors are not all equally sensitive in the first place.

The app cannot be removed from the running apps tab or it stops working. It disables Siri and voice dictation, which means you have to turn them on again every day. It counts all the time your phone is on, even when you’re not even using it. If your phone turns on for whatever reason the time counts against you.

Insult to adult parents!,"The developers of this app care about $$$ not protecting children/adolescents! Moreover, the software writers are likely young adults who are more interested in protecting the “rights” (insert laughter here) of children than they are about protecting vulnerable, naive, youth. No loving, intelligent, adult would ever weave together a corrupt app like this one. 
1.  To function properly, Verizon’s app must be installed on the child’s/children’s phone. I have 3 teenage daughters and a message goes to each of their phones to “ask their permission” to download and install the application. (Hello!  Anyone with common sense working at Verizon???)  What’s more, even if a parent is clever enough (which I am) to take their child’s/children’s phone and download/install the app on their phones and erase the footprint...(wait for it)...the dumb app sends text messages to the child/children to inform them they are being monitored and then “asks their permission” to allow the app to keep monitoring them!  (What idiots at Verizon, except young millennials with no children and no moral compass, would write such ridiculous procedures???). Once again, even if a parent is smart enough to compensate for this flaw (which I am) every time Vernon sends out a major update it notifies the child/children and, once again, asks them to approve the functionality of this insane app.  (Really Verizon???)  Now the parent has to confiscate their phone again and jump through all the flawed loops to protect the kid(s). INSANE!  To add further insult to injury, Verizon charges $10 a month so they can make believe they care about kids while giving youth full control over granting “permission” to be parented and then sticks the parent with a bill for Verizon’s “great service.” Crazy!

Marketing Opportunity with Modification of Program,"I have a special need that I had hoped this device would solve. It has the capability, if the app is modified,  and there is a big market out there that could be addressed if the app were modified. 

Specifically, my wife has Alzheimer’s and as it progresses she will tend to wander which could put her in danger. Two things need to be changed with location based notifications. The first is the radius of location limits which appears to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 600-700 feet. We have a thoroughfare within 150 feet of our home so 600-700 foot radius provides no protection if she leaves the home location. Second, the app has a two hour location window unless a user logs in every two hours and changes the time. There needs to be option to allow 24 hour surveillance and once a person goes location sends an alert every five or ten minutes and turns on tracking. It would really be nice if it could be programmed to automatically call caretaker and or 911 or both. Locations change as we visit our children and grand children.

If these changes were made,  this would be a really great product. As it is, it does not serve our needs. My wife loves the ability to call her kids and receive calls from them as keeping track of her cell phone is problematic.

Everyone must live their own life and get through the high and lows of it themselves. Unfortunately, this app takes away that ability for many people.

Snapchat or 1984?,"Remove. Snapmap. Immediately. I refuse to update the app until I have peace of mind in knowing that others can't see my location WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT INTENTIONS TO MAKE IT PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE.

They didn't need to know your location at all times, let alone what side of your house you're sitting at!!! Now, this is not the case. Snapmap allows others to see your location at all times and this is unacceptable. The &#34;ghost mode&#34; isn't acceptable either because it shows the location at which you enabled this mode. I do not feel safe knowing that my location is on a map for all to see. This is an issue of privacy and internet freedom. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.

Good app BUT,"I dislike that you cannot block certain YouTube channels. There's a channel called chases's corner and his fathers channel as well where they call each other names and talk about poop, boogers you know, immature kid talk that is not meant to be literal. However, my son is 4 and he hears them talking like that but he thinks they literally mean that. I hear him talk like that and it's disgusting. I moved to yt kids thinking it will have more control and maybe the channel won't be seen. However, the channel popped up and I know of no way to blocking it. So I cleared the history and hope it doesn't pop up again....if it does I'm completely removing all YouTube apps. My son loves to watch the kid stuff, the learning, music and art as well as kids playing games but since I cannot block specific channels I'm just going to have to fully remove all YouTube apps just so my son can stop hearing people talk nasty. This app just needs more control than what it currently has, which is not much.

For the commenter &#34;to the complainers&#34; about why would you leave your child alone watching whatever....that's the most idiotic commentary. No one is leaving their kid to be &#34;babysat&#34; by an app. Why do you think people came to yt kids....because they thought it was more parent friendly and had more filter control than the parent YouTube app. You said you would let them watch the app and periodically check in on them but isn't that exactly what you just said you wouldn't do...leave them alone and let it &#34;babysit&#34;? Gotta love hypocrites. 

Regardless, this app needs more controls so it can filter and be decided by the parents what will show up. There are a lot of educational, art, fun and interesting things for kids of all ages on YouTube and it all needs to be controlled by the parent to deem what's appropriate.

It seems that the app updates accurately & in real time as you move on your own device but delayed tracking other member devices.

I monitor my daughters use of this app, however, there is no way to stop those videos finding their way back. The app gives the option to turn off search, but then some of the best educational channels-won't show up. My daughter is special needs, and autistic. Some of the channels that would be appropriate for the average developing child is not always appropriate for children with special needs. They sometimes miss the context, and only see the bad behavior. So after no changes in a year, much to my daughters disappointment we have deleted the app. It got to the point where everyday there was an episode or more that I had to stop my daughter from watching, only to see it again later.

"Remember how Black Mirror S4 E2 ""Arkangel"" ended?","&#34;Arkangel” is the second episode of the fourth season of the hit Netflix series “Black Mirror”. Though the premise of an overprotective mother inserting a neural insert, through which she may monitor and even alter all aspects of her daughter’s life, may seem to be only a work of fiction within a dystopian alternate reality, it is already the reality for many of today’s youth. Apps such as Life 360, Find Your Friends, and even the instillation of in-house cameras are a reality that may give peace of mind to the parents but are proving disastrous for the teens who are forced to keep the app on their phone and must live under conditions in which their every move is monitored. There is even less trust between parent and child. Under the scrutiny of their parents, the mental health and well-being of the children is much worse. The parents who consider these applications their saviors are the same parents who do not understand the damage they are inflicting on their children; most likely they themselves grew up with much more free reign, with the ability to sneak out or ditch class or drive over the speed limit once in a while. 

I am already a college student; I will be 23 soon. I cannot even go to McDonalds at 3am without being criticized to the ends of the earth. I cannot ditch a lecture if I had a mental breakdown and need to be away from the public as they will see that I am not at the right location. They will know if I drove over the speed limit for like 2 minutes, because the app tells them that too. As other reviews have said, sometimes the GPS malfunctions and will show the location incorrectly. So sometimes I will be in class, but it will show that I am across campus, and they will not believe me when I say the app is wrong. So of course this leads to punishment, even closer monitoring of my actions, even more distrust and distance of an already far from healthy relationship. Why not just leave my phone and do my thing? Because they will call, or text, and if I do not answer right away, there is punishment. 

Those of you reading this may think “oh this can’t be real” or “oh this won’t be the case” or “this is an exception”, I swear to you this is not. Ask any Asian-American and they will tell you about how strict our parents can be. You are putting this power in the hands of people who will kill their children before it brings dishonor, in the hands of those who hurt their children and suffocate us because they “love” us, in the hands of narcissists, If you still think this is okay, that this is somehow a parental right, then you only have yourselves to blame for the fact 20% of all 13-18 year olds suffer from at least one mental illness (NAMI), that suicide is the second leading cause of death for 15- to 24- year olds (HHS.gov), that your teen does not trust you, tell you things, despises you, and/or fears you.

Big disappointment!,This is a good app if your looking for it to tell you the area of the person your looking for! But most of the time it doesn't work!!!! For instance I have it on 3 of our phones and if I check my sons phone during the day when I KNOW he's in school it will tell me he is across town! When I want to know where my mother is it will tell me she is in the next state over even though I just got off the phone with her and know exactly where she is!!!!! It also does NOT give you an address as to where the person is. It just gives you a general area (if it's correct). I find this app to be a great disappointment!!!,Truth,Honesty, 
Why?,Why is it that we don't have an option to hide the time stamps? I don't want people knowing every time I get online. That is so intrusive to all users privacy.

Read the Details - premium version,"This app is not all it’s cracked up to be in my opinion. I’ve used others that do a lot more for less. Here are my issues:
1.  Very difficult to install and get set up on children’s devices. Time consuming process.
2. It rearranged and jumbled all of the apps on my children’s devices. And the tool to fix it is currently out of commission and unavailable per Ourpact’s support. 
3. Currently it doesn’t allow per app time tracking due to utility mentioned in #2.
4. Time around tracking is a manual process that the child must turn off anon. Most parental control apps track time on iPhone case on with the lock screen is turned off and on AUTOMATICALLY.

Just Depressing,"The idea for the app is a good one. However, I'm disappointed by the execution. I'm not a fan of the segmenting. I think it needs work. Abilities vs. Signs is somewhat confusing and could be differentiated further. Maybe &#34;signs&#34; isn't the best word to use. Also, there are some inexcusable typos. When I pay decent money for an app, I expect for things to be proofread thoroughly.

My main issue with this app is the strategy. In terms of  &#34;abilities&#34; I find it extremely off-putting and distressing to simply list all of the difficult things a kid *might* be doing at that age. My kid just hit leap 8. He still cannot perform ANY of skills listed in &#34;abilities&#34; of Leap 7. I just polled moms of babies born in the same month as my son and they all say the same. So, if I did not speak to them, I would feel pretty worried about my kid. Maybe instead of listing (very advanced) skills, start with the bare basics and add an &#34;advanced&#34; section. I went to my pediatrician awhile back concerned that he wasn't responding to sounds/ turning his head (per the WW app). She told me kids don't usually do that for months. She has also told me WW is way off-base about several other &#34;abilities&#34;. 

As a parent &#34;abilities&#34; translates to &#34;expectations&#34; when in reality it should read &#34;advanced&#34; (according to your timelines). 

To the WW creators, please keep in mind your target audience: parents. What do parents want? To feel proud of their children and validated as parents. This app does not do that with the current structure (unless you have a very precocious child on your hands).",Honesty,Cognition,Visibility

Worthless...,"I think the reason most parents want an app like this is to see their kids texts and phone calls.  After I paid for the first month, they told me those options weren’t available on the iPhone.  This app is a complete waste of time and money.

Removed services from free app,"I have used this app for years and as a mother to a younger child, I downloaded this mainly to be able to access crime and offended reports. The app use to show locations where a recent crime has occurred and where sex offenders live. This has been helpful when deciding where to live, where to take my child for events, playgroups, and even just to know which houses to avoid when trick or treating.  
But sometime in the past year, they took these services out of the basic plan and now you can’t see those items unless you have a premium or higher account. Now they advertise this as if that’s normal and those of us who have used it for years are forced to upgrade and pay for services we don’t need/use to see the same information that’s always been free. I appreciate that apps need to make $ and they have done well in creating  plenty of new and valuable services to that end.
